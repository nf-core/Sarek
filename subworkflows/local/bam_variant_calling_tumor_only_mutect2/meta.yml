name: bam_variant_calling_tumor_only_mutect2
description: |
  Perform variant calling on a single tumor sample using mutect2 tumor only mode.
  f1r2 output of mutect2 is run through learnreadorientationmodel to get the artifact priors.
  Run the input bam files through getpileupsummarries and then calculatecontamination to get the contamination and segmentation tables.
  Filter the mutect2 output vcf using filtermutectcalls, artifact priors and the contamination & segmentation tables for additional filtering.
  Optional joint calling of multiple tumor.
