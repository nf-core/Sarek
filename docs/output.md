## Preprocessing
Sarek preprocessing raw FastQ files or unmapped BAM files is based on [GATK best practices](https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/best-practices/).
BAM files with Recalibration tables can also be used as an input to start with the recalibration of said BAM files.

### Duplicate Marked BAM file(s) with Recalibration Table(s)

**Output directory: `results/Preprocessing/[SAMPLE]/DuplicateMarked`**

* `Sample.md.bam`, `Sample.md.bai` and `Sample.recal.table`
  * BAM file and index with Recalibration Table

### Recalibrated BAM file(s)

This directory is usually empty, it is the location for the final recalibrated files in the preprocessing pipeline: recalibrated BAM files are usually 2-3 times larger than the duplicate marked BAM files.
To re-generate recalibrated BAM file you have to apply the recalibration table delivered to the `DuplicateMarked` directory either within sarek, or doing this [recalibration step] yourself.

**Output directory: `results/Preprocessing/[SAMPLE]/Recalibrated`**

* `Sample.recal.bam` and `Sample.recal.bai`
  * BAM file and index

### TSV files
The TSV files are autogenerated and can be used by Sarek for further processing and/or variant calling.

**Output directory: `results/Preprocessing/TSV`**

* `duplicateMarked.tsv` and `recalibrated.tsv`
  * TSV files to start Sarek from `recalibration` or `variantcalling` steps.
* `duplicateMarked_Sample.tsv` and `recalibrated_Sample.tsv`
    * TSV files to start Sarek from `recalibration` or `variantcalling` steps for a specific sample.

## Variant Calling
All the results regarding variant-calling are collected in this directory.

## Annotation

This directory contains results from the final annotation steps: two software are used for annotation, [VEP][vep-link] and [snpEff][snpeff-link].
Only a subset of the VCF files are annotated, and only variants that have a PASS filter.
FreeBayes results are not annotated in the moment yet as we are lacking a decent somatic filter.
For HaplotypeCaller the germline variations are annotated for both the tumour and the normal sample.

The generated VCF header contains the software version, also the version numbers for additional databases like Clinvar or dbSNP used in the "VEP" line.
